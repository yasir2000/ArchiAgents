**Key Features:**
- **Autonomous Mode**: Enable/disable automatic decision approval
- **Phase Management**: Start and track TOGAF phases
- **Event Logging**: Complete audit trail of all actions
- **Health Monitoring**: Real-time architecture health scoring (0-100)
- **Auto-Response**: Automatic action generation for critical issues
- **Comprehensive Reporting**: Status reports with metrics and recommendations

**Usage:**
```python
from runtime_intelligence import AutonomousArchitectureController

# Initialize controller
controller = AutonomousArchitectureController(
    enterprise_name="GlobalTech Corporation",
    project_name="Digital Transformation",
    autonomous_mode=True  # Enable autonomous decision-making
)

# Start a TOGAF phase
recommendations = controller.start_phase(
    phase="phase_a",
    objectives=[
        "Define architecture vision",
        "Identify stakeholders",
        "Establish governance"
    ]
)

# Get architecture health
health = controller.get_architecture_health()
print(f"Health Score: {health['score']}/100")
print(f"Status: {health['status']}")
```

### 2. Decision Engine

## Key Workflows

### Autonomous Phase Management

```python
# Initialize autonomous controller
controller = AutonomousArchitectureController(
    enterprise_name="GlobalTech Corp",
    project_name="Digital Transformation",
    autonomous_mode=True
)

# Start Phase A with objectives
recommendations = controller.start_phase(
    phase="phase_a",
    objectives=[
        "Define architecture vision",
        "Identify stakeholders",
        "Establish governance framework",
        "Define business principles"
    ]
)

print(f"Generated {len(recommendations)} recommendations")

# Build ArchiMate model
controller.archimate_analyzer.add_element(ArchiMateElement(
    id="CAP-001",
    name="Digital Customer Engagement",
    element_type=ElementType.CAPABILITY,
    layer=ArchiMateLayer.STRATEGY
))

# Perform autonomous analysis
insights = controller.analyze_architecture()

print(f"Found {len(insights)} insights")

# Make autonomous decision
decision = controller.make_autonomous_decision(
    decision_title="Cloud Migration Strategy",
    decision_context={
        "scope": "Cloud Migration Strategy",
        "phase": "phase_a",
        "layer": "strategy",
        "type": "strategic",
        "priority": "high"
    },
    options=[
        {
            "name": "Lift and Shift",
            "description": "Migrate as-is",
            "feasibility": 0.9,
            "cost": 500000,
            "time_days": 90,
            "complexity": 0.3,
            "risk": 0.2
        }
    ]
)

# Check architecture health
health = controller.get_architecture_health()
print(f"Health Score: {health['score']}/100 ({health['status']})")

# Generate comprehensive report
report = controller.generate_report()
print(report)
```

### Impact Assessment

```python
# Assess impact of architectural change
impact = controller.assess_impact(
    element_id="APP-002",
    change_type="replace",
    change_description="Replace legacy CRM with modern solution"
)

print(f"Severity: {impact['severity']}")
print(f"Affected Elements: {len(impact['affected_elements'])}")

# Auto-mitigation will be generated for high/critical impact
if 'auto_mitigation' in impact:
    print("Auto-Mitigation Plan:")
    for step in impact['auto_mitigation']['steps']:
        print(f"  - {step}")
```

### Health Monitoring

```python
# Get current architecture health
health = controller.get_architecture_health()

print(f"Health Score: {health['score']}/100")
print(f"Status: {health['status']}")
print(f"Critical Issues: {health['critical_count']}")
print(f"High Issues: {health['high_count']}")
print(f"Medium Issues: {health['medium_count']}")

# Health-based recommendations
for rec in health['recommendations']:
    print(f"  â†’ {rec}")
```

## Decision Types & Scoring

### Composite Scoring Weights

Different decision types use different scoring weights to reflect priorities:

**STRATEGIC Decisions** (Focus: Alignment)
- Strategic Alignment: 40%
- Feasibility: 20%
- Risk Level: 20%
- Cost: 20%

**TACTICAL Decisions** (Focus: Balance)
- Feasibility: 30%
- Technical Fit: 30%
- Complexity: 20%
- Cost: 20%

**TECHNICAL Decisions** (Focus: Technical Fit)
- Technical Fit: 40%
- Feasibility: 30%
- Complexity: 20%
- Cost: 10%

**ORGANIZATIONAL Decisions** (Focus: Feasibility & Alignment)
- Feasibility: 30%
- Strategic Alignment: 30%
- Risk Level: 20%
- Cost: 20%

**GOVERNANCE Decisions** (Focus: Feasibility & Risk)
- Feasibility: 30%
- Risk Level: 30%
- Strategic Alignment: 20%
- Cost: 20%

**RISK Decisions** (Focus: Risk)
- Risk Level: 40%
- Feasibility: 30%
- Cost: 20%
- Technical Fit: 10%

**COMPLIANCE Decisions** (Focus: Feasibility & Risk)
- Feasibility: 40%
- Risk Level: 30%
- Cost: 20%
- Technical Fit: 10%

**OPTIMIZATION Decisions** (Focus: Technical & Complexity)
- Technical Fit: 30%
- Complexity: 30%
- Cost: 20%
- Feasibility: 20%

### Confidence Calculation

Confidence is determined by the score spread between the top two options:

- **Spread > 0.3**: VERY_HIGH confidence (90-100%)
- **Spread > 0.2**: HIGH confidence (75-90%)
- **Spread > 0.1**: MEDIUM confidence (50-75%)
- **Spread > 0.05**: LOW confidence (25-50%)
- **Spread â‰¤ 0.05**: VERY_LOW confidence (<25%)

## Architecture Health Scoring

Health score is calculated as: `100 - (criticalÃ—20 + highÃ—10 + mediumÃ—5)`

**Health Status Levels:**
- **HEALTHY** (80-100): Architecture in good condition
- **FAIR** (60-79): Some issues to address
- **AT_RISK** (40-59): Significant issues requiring attention
- **CRITICAL** (<40): Urgent action required

## Best Practices

### 1. Start with Autonomous Mode Disabled

```python
# Start with manual review
controller = AutonomousArchitectureController(
    enterprise_name="MyOrg",
    project_name="MyProject",
    autonomous_mode=False  # Require manual approval
)

# Review recommendations before enabling autonomous mode
```

### 2. Build Complete ArchiMate Models

```python
# Include elements from all relevant layers
analyzer.add_element(...)  # Strategy layer
analyzer.add_element(...)  # Business layer
analyzer.add_element(...)  # Application layer
analyzer.add_element(...)  # Technology layer

# Add relationships to connect layers
analyzer.add_relationship(...)
```

### 3. Provide Rich Decision Context

```python
context = DecisionContext(
    decision_type=DecisionType.STRATEGIC,
    priority=DecisionPriority.HIGH,
    togaf_phase="phase_a",
    archimate_layer="strategy",
    decision_scope="Clear scope description",
    business_drivers=["Specific", "Measurable", "Drivers"],
    stakeholders=["CTO", "CFO", "Business Leaders"],
    constraints=["Budget: $5M", "Timeline: 12 months"],
    current_state="Detailed current state",
    target_state="Clear target state"
)
```

### 4. Define Comprehensive Options

```python
option = DecisionOption(
    name="Clear Option Name",
    description="Detailed description",
    # Scores (0.0 to 1.0)
    feasibility=0.8,
    strategic_alignment=0.9,
    technical_fit=0.85,
    # Risk (0.0 = low, 1.0 = high)
    risk_level=0.3,
    # Complexity (0.0 = simple, 1.0 = complex)
    complexity=0.4,
    # Financial
    cost=1500000,
    # Timeline
    estimated_time_days=180,
    # Qualitative
    benefits=["Benefit 1", "Benefit 2"],
    dependencies=["Dependency 1"],
    constraints=["Constraint 1"]
)
```

### 5. Regular Health Monitoring

```python
# Monitor health regularly
health = controller.get_architecture_health()

if health['status'] == 'critical':
    # Take immediate action
    print("CRITICAL: Urgent action required")
    
    # Review critical issues
    for insight in health['insights']:
        if insight.severity == 'critical':
            # Address critical issues
            pass
```

### 6. Leverage Event Logging

```python
# Review event history
for event in controller.events:
    print(f"{event['timestamp']}: {event['type']} - {event['description']}")
```

### 7. Progressive Autonomy

```python
# Start manual
controller.autonomous_mode = False

# Build confidence
# ... make several decisions with manual review ...

# Enable autonomy for low-risk decisions
if decision.priority == DecisionPriority.LOW and decision.confidence == 'very_high':
    controller.autonomous_mode = True
```

## Integration with AI Multi-Agent System

The Runtime Intelligence Layer integrates seamlessly with the existing AI Multi-Agent System:

```python
from ai_orchestrator import TOGAFOrchestrator
from runtime_intelligence import AutonomousArchitectureController

# Create orchestrator with runtime intelligence
orchestrator = TOGAFOrchestrator(
    enterprise_name="GlobalTech",
    project_name="Digital Transformation"
)

# Create runtime intelligence controller
controller = AutonomousArchitectureController(
    enterprise_name="GlobalTech",
    project_name="Digital Transformation",
    llm=orchestrator.llm  # Use same LLM
)

# Execute phase with AI agents
result = await orchestrator.execute_phase_async(
    phase="phase_a",
    objectives=["Define vision", "Identify stakeholders"]
)

# Get autonomous recommendations
recommendations = controller.start_phase(
    phase="phase_a",
    objectives=["Define vision", "Identify stakeholders"]
)

# Combine AI agent outputs with runtime intelligence
# - AI agents provide content generation
# - Runtime intelligence provides guidance and validation
```

## Performance Metrics

The Runtime Intelligence Layer tracks key metrics:

**Decision Metrics:**
- Decision count by type, priority, confidence
- Average decision time
- Decision approval rate (autonomous vs manual)
- Decision success rate (requires feedback)

**Analysis Metrics:**
- Analysis execution time
- Insights generated by severity
- Model complexity (elements, relationships, layers)
- Pattern recognition rate

**Phase Metrics:**
- Phase progress percentage
- Deliverable completion rate
- Decision completion rate
- Time per phase

**Health Metrics:**
- Health score trend over time
- Issue resolution time by severity
- Critical issue count
- Health status distribution

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Low Confidence Decisions

**Cause:** Options too similar in scoring

**Solution:**
1. Differentiate options more clearly
2. Add more evaluation criteria
3. Use AI-based analysis for nuanced evaluation
4. Review decision type weights

### Issue: Too Many Insights

**Cause:** Incomplete ArchiMate model

**Solution:**
1. Add missing layer elements
2. Add relationships between elements
3. Use progressive refinement (start simple, add detail)

### Issue: Low Health Score

**Cause:** Unresolved critical/high issues

**Solution:**
1. Review critical insights first
2. Follow auto-generated mitigation plans
3. Address high-coupling and circular dependencies
4. Complete missing deliverables

### Issue: Incorrect Progress Calculation

**Cause:** Missing deliverable/decision tracking

**Solution:**
1. Record completed deliverables
2. Record completed decisions
3. Verify phase objectives are complete
