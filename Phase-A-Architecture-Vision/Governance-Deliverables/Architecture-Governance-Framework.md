## Governance Processes

### Architecture Decision Process
#### Decision Types
1. **Strategic Decisions:** High-level architecture direction and principles
2. **Design Decisions:** Specific architectural designs and patterns
3. **Standard Decisions:** Technology standards and guidelines
4. **Exception Decisions:** Deviations from established standards

#### Decision Flow
```
Request Initiation → Impact Assessment → Stakeholder Consultation → 
Architecture Review → Risk Assessment → Decision Authority Review → 
Decision Communication → Implementation Monitoring
```

#### Decision Authority Matrix
| Decision Type | Authority Level | Approval Body |
|---------------|----------------|---------------|
| Strategic Architecture | Executive | AGB + Executive Sponsor |
| Design Standards | Senior Management | AGB |
| Technical Standards | Management | ARB + TSC |
| Project Exceptions | Operational | ARB |
| Operational Changes | Tactical | Domain Architects |

### Architecture Review Process
#### Review Triggers
- Project initiation and key milestones
- Significant design changes
- Technology selection decisions
- Compliance requirement changes
- Risk threshold breaches

#### Review Stages
1. **Initial Assessment:** Scope and impact evaluation
2. **Detailed Review:** Comprehensive architecture analysis
3. **Stakeholder Consultation:** Input from affected parties
4. **Risk Assessment:** Identification and mitigation planning
5. **Decision and Approval:** Formal approval or rejection
6. **Communication:** Decision dissemination
7. **Follow-up:** Implementation monitoring

#### Review Criteria
- Business alignment and value
- Technical feasibility and risk
- Compliance and security
- Cost and resource implications
- Integration and interoperability
- Scalability and performance
- Maintainability and sustainability

### Exception Management Process
#### Exception Categories
1. **Technical Exceptions:** Deviations from technical standards
2. **Timeline Exceptions:** Accelerated implementation requirements
3. **Resource Exceptions:** Resource constraint accommodations
4. **Compliance Exceptions:** Temporary compliance deferrals

#### Exception Approval Process
```
Exception Request → Impact Analysis → Risk Assessment → 
Alternative Evaluation → Stakeholder Consultation → 
Approval Authority Decision → Remediation Planning → 
Monitoring and Review
```

#### Exception Documentation Requirements
- Business justification
- Technical rationale
- Risk assessment and mitigation
- Timeline and scope
