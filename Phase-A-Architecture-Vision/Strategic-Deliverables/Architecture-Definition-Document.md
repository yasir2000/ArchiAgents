# Architecture Definition Document

## Purpose
This document provides a qualitative view of the solution architecture, describing the baseline and target architectures, key architectural decisions, and the rationale for those decisions. It serves as a reference for stakeholders and guides implementation.

## Contents
- Executive Summary
- Baseline Architecture Overview
- Target Architecture Overview
- Architecture Principles Applied
- Key Design Decisions
- Solution Overview (Business, Data, Application, Technology)
- Architecture Models and Diagrams
- Assumptions and Constraints
- Risks and Mitigations
- Traceability to Requirements

## 1. Executive Summary
_Provide a high-level summary of the architecture and its business value._

## 2. Baseline Architecture Overview
_Describe the current state architecture, including key systems, processes, and technologies._

## 3. Target Architecture Overview
_Describe the future state architecture, including improvements, new capabilities, and technology changes._

## 4. Architecture Principles Applied
_List the key architecture principles that guided the design._

## 5. Key Design Decisions
_Summarize major architectural decisions and their rationale._

## 6. Solution Overview
### 6.1 Business Architecture
_Describe business processes, functions, and organizational impacts._

### 6.2 Data Architecture
_Describe data entities, flows, and management._

### 6.3 Application Architecture
_Describe applications, interfaces, and integration points._

### 6.4 Technology Architecture
_Describe infrastructure, platforms, and technology standards._

## 7. Architecture Models and Diagrams
_Include relevant diagrams (e.g., context, component, data flow, deployment)._ 

## 8. Assumptions and Constraints
_List any assumptions and constraints that impact the architecture._

## 9. Risks and Mitigations
_Identify key risks and proposed mitigations._

## 10. Traceability to Requirements
