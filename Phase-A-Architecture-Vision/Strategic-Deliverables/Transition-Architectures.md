# Transition Architectures

## Purpose
Transition Architectures describe the intermediate states between the current (baseline) and target architectures. They provide a stepwise approach to transformation, reducing risk and enabling incremental value delivery.

## Contents
- Introduction
- Baseline Architecture Summary
- Target Architecture Summary
- Transition Architecture States
- Key Changes and Rationale
- Dependencies and Risks
- Timeline and Milestones

## 1. Introduction

## 3. Target Architecture Summary
_Summarize the future state architecture._

## 4. Transition Architecture States
_Describe each intermediate state, including capabilities, systems, and processes._

## 5. Key Changes and Rationale
_Explain the major changes and why they are needed at each stage._

## 6. Dependencies and Risks
_Identify dependencies and risks for each transition state._

## 7. Timeline and Milestones
_Provide a timeline for each transition state and key milestones._
