## Executive Summary

This document defines the comprehensive Architecture Change Control Process for managing, evaluating, and implementing changes to the enterprise architecture. The process ensures that all architectural modifications are properly assessed for impact, risk, and business value while maintaining architectural integrity and alignment with strategic objectives.

### Key Points
- **Controlled Change Management:** Structured process for evaluating and approving architecture changes
- **Impact Assessment Framework:** Comprehensive analysis of technical, business, and risk implications
- **Stakeholder Governance:** Clear roles, responsibilities, and approval authorities
- **Version Control Integration:** Seamless integration with configuration management systems
- **Continuous Monitoring:** Real-time tracking of change implementation and effectiveness
