## 3.1 Core Elements

The ArchiMate core elements belong to one of 3 categories (think about them from one graph / triple aspect):

 - Active Structure Elements (Subject)
 - Behavior Elements (Predicate)
 - Passive Structure Elements (Object)

Support _service-oriented_ viewpoints:

- Enternal Behavior Elements (Services)
- Internal Behavior Elements (Processes & Functions)
- External Active Structure Elements (Interfaces)
- Internal Active Structure Elements (Actors, Roles, Applications, Devices)

## 3.2 Core Relationships

Four relationships categories:

| Category | Purpose | Relationships |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Structural | Model the static construction or composition of elements | composition, aggregation, realization, assignment |
| Dependency | How elements support each other | serving, access, influence, association |
| Dynamic | Model information and control flows between elements | triggering, flow |
| Specialization | others | specializing |

The language __does not allow__ elements and relationships to be combined arbitrarily (任意地).

## 3.3 Extension Layers and Elements

- Strategy Layer (change to "Layer" from 3.2): Resource, Capability, Course of Action, Value Stream
- Motivation Elements: Stakeholder, Driver, Assessment, Goal, Outcome, Principle, Requirement, Constraint, Meaning, Value
- Implementation and Migration Layer: Work Package, Deliverable, Implementation Event, Plateau, Gap
- Composition Elements: Location, Grouping

## 3.4 ArchiMate Language Customization

- ArchiMate Model File: [ArchiMate_SABSA_Figure02.archimate](./ArchiMate_SABSA_Figure02.archimate)
- ArchiMate Exported Image: [Figure02_In-Model-vs-Out-of-Model-Specialization.png](./Figure02_In-Model-vs-Out-of-Model-Specialization.png)

### 3.4.1 User-Defined Attributes

link to ArchiMate Specification 14.1 "Adding Attributes to ArchiMate Concepts"
- Both the ArchiMate Specification and the Model Exchange File Format support basic property types: string, integer, real, boolean, currency, date, time, URL, etc.
- In order to support compound properties, the Security Overlay occasionally uses text strings in JavaScript™ Object Notation (JSON) format

### 3.4.2 Sepcialization and "Stereotypes" -- IMPORTANT

- "In-Model" specialization uses the specoialization relationship introducted in [3.2.1](#32-core-relationships) to show that one element is a particular kind of another (i.e. a subtype)
- "Out-of-Model" specialization is denoted by double chevrons in a type-qualified name (resembinling a UML stereotype: « »)
  - "Staff Member" is modeled using Specialization relation
  - "Threat Agent" is modeled using «_stereotype_» notation, emphasizing that it is somewhat untypical of "a _buisness entity of performing behavior_", it is not derived from another Actor via inheritance.
- "isAbstract" property is denoted by Security Overlay with its name in _Italics_, which is another UML convention.

### 3.4.3 Overloaded Relationships

The ArchiMate language uses relationship overloading: the same symbol represents different but semantically compatible concepts in different context.

Overloading trades minimization of the vocabulary for a minor loss of precision.

The Security Overlay will further overload relationships in keeping with this general principles.

## 3.5 The ArchiMate Full Framework

You already see this in [Chapter 1: Introduction](../01_Introduction/README.md):

Then below is the mapping of the ArchiMate Specification to the TOGAF Architecture Development Method (ADM):
