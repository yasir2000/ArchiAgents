    documentation="A service is a means of enabling value co-creation by facilitating outcomes that customers want to achieve, without the customer having to manage specific costs and risks.&#xD;&#xA;* The services an organization provides are based on one or more of its products.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A product is a configuration of resources, created by the organization, that will be potentially valuable for their customers.&#xD;&#xA;* Products are typically complex and not fully visible to the consumer. The portion of a product that the consumer actually sees does not always represent all of the components that comprise the product and support its delivery.&#xD;&#xA;* Organizations define which product components their consumer see, and tailor them to suit their target consumer groups."/>
