    documentation="Malware (a portmanteau for malicious software) is any software intentionally designed to cause damage to a computer, server, client, or computer network. Malware does the damage after it is implanted or introduced in some way into a target's computer and can take the form of executable code, scripts, active content, and other software. The code is described as computer viruses, worms, Trojan horses, ransomware, spyware, adware, and scareware, among other terms. Malware has a malicious intent, acting against the interest of the computer userâ€”and so does not include software that causes unintentional harm due to some deficiency, which is typically described as a software bug.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;https://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/definition/malware"/>
