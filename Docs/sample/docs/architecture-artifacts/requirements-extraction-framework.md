# Requirements Extraction Framework

## Overview
Comprehensive framework for extracting insights from user requirements specifications and conducting effective business discussions to craft aligned solutions architecture.

## ðŸ“‹ Requirements Analysis Process

### 1. Initial Requirements Gathering
