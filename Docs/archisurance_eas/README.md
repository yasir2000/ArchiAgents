# ArchiSurance (ArchiMate) with Essential EAS EA Tool

Using Essential (OpenSource) EAS - Enterprise Architecture Tool to model OpenGroup's ArchiSurance (ArchiMate) Case Study, learn by practicing!

The ArchiSurance Case Study is a fictitious example developed to illustrate the use of the ArchiMate® modeling language in the context of the TOGAF® framework.

Open Group publishes the ArchiSurance online model here: https://pubs.opengroup.org/architecture/case-study-models/archisurance-html/, which you can explore using web browser.

Essential EAS is developed by "[Essential Project](https://enterprise-architecture.org/)", it's the only vendor recognized as a Visionary in the 2023 Gartner Magic Quadrant for EA Tools

I've started practicing ArchiMate from 2020, and in recent two years tried Essential's Open Source edition, both are quite fit the needs on the enterprise architectural modeling.

Although the meta-models are slightly different each other, I think the synergy can still be found from their common viewpoints on EA modeling respectively.

This repository aims to follow ArchiSurance case study, and making step-by-step modeling the contents into Essential, to see how we can leveral Essential's nice views to present the ArchiSurance artefacts.

Hope you can find this journey as an useful reference to your EA modeling practice!
