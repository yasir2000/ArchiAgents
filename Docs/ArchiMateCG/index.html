                 <p> The ArchiMateCG editor and analyser is a solution aiming at assessing the value of using ArchiMate Interactive Compound Graphs for the various stakeholders involved in 
                    architecting the enterprise for its digitalisation and who adopted the 
                    <a href="https://pubs.opengroup.org/architecture/archimate3-doc/">ArchiMate® 3.2</a> language as the standardized architecture description language.
                </p>
                <p class="MsoNormal">ArchiMateCG aims at serving actors dealing with End to End Digital Processes, Model Based System Engineering, Product Lifecycle Management industrial approach (as defined by 
                    <a href="https://www.cimdata.com/en/resources/about-plm">CIMDATA</a>) and Interoperability of Enterprise Application.
                </p>
                <p class="MsoNormal">For this, ArchiMateCG supports creation of advanced interactive compound graphs visualization and algorithms in order to analyze architecture descriptions and blueprints produced using the ArchiMate language.</p>
                <p class="MsoNormal">ArchiMateCG is not intended to replace legacy ArchiMate modeling platforms and enterprise repositories, but to complement and extend them with previously described features.</p>
                <p class="MsoNormal">Consequently, ArchiMateCG comes with various import and export 
                    functionalities, and complementary sets of scripts for <a href="https://www.archimatetool.com/">Archi</a> and
                    <a href="https://sparxsystems.com/enterprise_architect_user_guide/15.2/model_domains/archimate.html"> Enterprise Architect.</a>
                </p>
                <p class="MsoNormal">ArchiMateCG is realized by combined usage of standardized Web technologies such as HTML, SVG, and JavaScript, in order to run on and require only a Web Navigator.</p>
                <p class="MsoNormal">Finally, ArchiMateCG is a research demonstrator, aiming at demonstrating and assessing research results on Continuous Operational Interoperability for digital collaboration within and between enterprises applying Model Based approaches. 
                    It will in particular address the combined usage of 
                    <a href="https://www.w3.org/wiki/LinkedData">Linked Data</a>, 
                    <a href="https://www.w3.org/standards/semanticweb/">Semantic Web</a>, 
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_10303">Standardized Application Protocols</a>,

                </p>
                <p class="MsoNormal">It doesnt prevent you to use it for quite simpler purpose, quick visualisation of data as graphs with nested nodes, importing data or creating it as easily than in a mindmap solution.</p>
              
                <p class="MsoNormal"><p><b>ArchiMateCG</b> is an all initiative launched end of 2024 aiming at accelerating collectively innovation required for solving issues related to secured continuous digital collaboration in a more and more VUCA environment.</p>
                <p>The initiative was launched by Dr Nicolas Figay, <a href="https://liris.cnrs.fr/page-membre/nicolas-figay">external LIRIS' collaborator</a>, but also ISO (SC4 TC184), Airbus, <a href="http://www.asd-ssg.org/">ASD Strategic Standardisation Group</a> and <a href="https://www.openpeoplefactory.fr/notre-ruche-d-experts-open-people-factory/">OpenPeopleFactory</a>expert, in order to disseminate and promote his research work (PHD "Interoperability of Technical Enteprise Interoperability" and HDR on "Continuous Operationa Interoperability" ) and derived proposed practices for the required improvment of the State of the Art and of the State of the Practices. Indeed, many enterprises and organisations are today at risks when considering the difficulties to set up sustainable secured digital collaboration with the required continous operational continuity.</p>
                <p>This is true in particular with the growing rate of emerging technologies such as blockchain, Generative AI, Data Mesh, System Modeling or Digital Twins.</p>
                <p>Publishing ArchiMateCG but also some other tools as open source is not only aiming at disseminating research results but also at onboarding various profile of users and stakeholders for further development and exploration.</p>

            <p>An alternative way for producing matrixes from a graph is to generate pivot tables relying on legacy javascript libraries. </p>

            <p>It is possible to add new sets of icons in the palette dedicated to a given topic which can be, or not, an extension of ArchiMate, or an alternative modeling language to be used in conjunction with ArchiMate.</p>
            <p>An example is given with the "Complexity" tool which is about describing the compelx connected systems industry is dealing with, being for aeronautic, automative, space or city surveillance, with associated enterprise application families related to PLM, MES, MOM, ERP, etc.</p>
            <p>Such visual elements can enrich the semantic of the cartography, using symbols not only for ArchiMate language constructs, but also for the kind of systems which are bing developed or supporting the working organisations.</p>
