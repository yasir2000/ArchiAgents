ArchiMateCG is an initiative aiming at accelerating collectively innovation required for solving issues related to secured continuous digital collaboration in a more and more VUCA environment.

The initiative was launched by Dr Nicolas Figay, external LIRIS' collaborator, but also ISO (SC4 TC184), Airbus, ASD Strategic Standardisation Group and OpenPeopleFactoryexpert, in order to disseminate and promote his research work (PHD "Interoperability of Technical Enteprise Interoperability" and HDR on "Continuous Operationa Interoperability" ) and derived proposed practices for the required improvment of the State of the Art and of the State of the Practices. Indeed, many enterprises and organisations are today at risks when considering the difficulties to set up sustainable secured digital collaboration with the required continous operational continuity.

This is true in particular with the growing rate of emerging technologies such as blockchain, Generative AI, Data Mesh, System Modeling or Digital Twins.

The ArchiMateCG editor is a solution aiming at assessing the value of using ArchiMate Interactive Compound Graphs for the various stakeholders involved in architecting the enterprise for its digitalisation and who adopted the ArchiMateÂ® 3.2 language as the standardized architecture description language.

ArchiMateCG aims at serving actors dealing with End to End Digital Processes, Model Based System Engineering, Product Lifecycle Management industrial approach (as defined by CIMDATA) and Interoperability of Enterprise Application.

For this, ArchiMateCG supports creation of advanced interactive compound graphs visualization and algorithms in order to analyze architecture descriptions and blueprints produced using the ArchiMate language.

ArchiMateCG is not intended to replace legacy ArchiMate modeling platforms and enterprise repositories, but to complement and extend them with previously described features.

Consequently, ArchiMateCG comes with various import and export functionalities, and complementary sets of scripts for Archi and Enterprise Architect.

ArchiMateCG is realized by combined usage of standardized Web technologies such as HTML, SVG, and JavaScript, in order to run on and require only a Web Navigator.

Finally, ArchiMateCG is a research incubator, aiming at demonstrating and assessing research results on Continuous Operational Interoperability for digital collaboration within and between enterprises applying Model Based approaches. It will in particular address the combined usage of Linked Data, Semantic Web, Standardized Application Protocols, Advanced visualization technologies and Graph based technologies.
