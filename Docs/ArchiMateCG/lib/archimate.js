  The Layered viewpoint pictures several layers and aspects of an Enterprise Architecture in one diagram.
  There are two categories of layers, namely dedicated layers and service layers. The layers are the result of the Use
  of the "grouping" relationship for a natural partitioning of the entire set of objects and relationships that belong
  to a model. The technology, application, process, and actor/role layers belong to the first category. The structural
  principle behind a fully layered viewpoint is that each dedicated layer exposes, by means of the "realization"
  relationship, a layer of services, which are further on "serving" the next dedicated layer.
  Thus, we can easily separate the internal structure and organization of a dedicated layer from its externally
  observable behavior expressed as the service layer that the dedicated layer realizes.
  The main goal of the layered viewpoint is to provide an overview in one diagram. Furthermore, this viewpoint can be
  used as support for impact of change analysis and performance analysis or for extending the service portfolio`,

     Enterprise Architecture during the change process.
   * The change process may have to deal with immature technology standards (e.g., messaging, security, data, etc.).
   * The change has serious consequences for the personnel, culture, way of working, and organization.

In this case, it may be realised as a Data Object or Representation.<br/>
It may also be specialised by another Business Object.<br/>
Business Objects are passive. They do not trigger or perform processes.<br/>
Business Objects may be accessed by a Business Process, Function, Interaction, Event, or Service.<br/>
A Business Object may have Association, Specialization, Aggregation, or Composition<br/>
relationships with other Business Objects.<br/>
A Business Object may be realized by a Representation or by a Data Object (or both).<br/>

const value_html = `<div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"  align="justify"><div class="name" style="display:block;"><h2>Value</h2></div>
<div class="description"><strong>Description: </strong>Value represents the relative worth, utility, or importance of a concept.<br/>
Value may apply to what a party gets by selling or making available some product or service,<br/>
or it may apply to what a party gets by buying or obtaining access to it.<br/>
Value may be expressed in terms of money, but non-monetary value is also essential to business<br/>
- for example, practical/functional value (including the right to use a service),<br/>
and the value of information or knowledge.<br/>
Though Value can hold internally for some system or organisational unit,<br/>
it is most typically applied to external appreciation of goods, services, information, knowledge,<br/>
or money, normally as part of some sort of customer-provider relationship.<br/>
A Value can be associated with any concept. To model the stakeholder for whom this Value applies,<br/>
this stakeholder can also be associated with that Value.<br/>
It is recommended to try and express the name of a Value as an action or state that can be performed<br/>
or reached as a result of the corresponding service being available.

<div class="description"><strong>Description: </strong>A Value Stream represents a sequence of activities that create an overall result for a customer, stakeholder, or end user.<br/>
A value stream describes how an enterprise organizes its activities to create value.<br/>
Value streams are typically realized by business processes and possibly other core behavior elements.<br/>
Value streams may be defined at different levels of the organization;<br/>
e.g., at the enterprise level, business unit level, or department level.<br/>
Value streams can be a composition or aggregation of value-adding activities.<br/>
These are also modeled with the value stream element and are known as value (stream) stages,<br/>
each of which creates and adds incremental value from one stage to the next.<br/> 
These stages are typically related using flow relationships to model the flow of value between them.<br/>
Resources can be assigned to value streams and capabilities can serve (i.e., enable) a value stream
