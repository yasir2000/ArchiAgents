    <h2>Adding Elements Directly to the Model Tree</h2>
    
    <p>To add new ArchiMate elements directly to the Model Tree, select one of the folders, "Business", "Application", "Technology" or "Connectors" and right-click. A "New" menu item allows you to add new elements to the tree:</p>
    
    <img src="../Images/model-tree-add.png"/>
    <p class="caption">Adding a new element directly to the Model Tree</p>
    
    <p>When the element is added to the Model Tree, the focus is given to the element and you can provide a new name for it.</p>
    
    <p>Note that it is not possible to add relationships directly to the Model Tree as these can only be added by drawing them in the View (diagram) editor window.</p>

    <br/>

    <h2>Specialized Elements in the "New" menu</h2>

    <p>If you have created <a href="specializations_manager.html">Specialized Elements</a> these will show in the "New" right-click menu, at the bottom of the list of elements, to enable you to quickly add specialized elements to a model like any other element. This can be enabled or disabled in <a href="prefs_general.html">Preferences</a>.</p>
