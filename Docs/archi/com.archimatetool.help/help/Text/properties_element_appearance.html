    <h2>Element Appearance Properties</h2>
    
    <p>Selecting an element in a View means that you can edit or view additional visual properties in the Properties Window. Different visual settings can be applied to an element for each separate occurrence in a View. For example, the element "Application Service" may be coloured blue in one View, and grey in another View.</p>

    <p>By default, an element's name will be displayed in any View in which it appears. Using a label expression per View instance, you can choose what is displayed for the element in the View. For example you may wish to display the element's name and its type. Or you may wish to display the value of one or more of its properties.</p>
