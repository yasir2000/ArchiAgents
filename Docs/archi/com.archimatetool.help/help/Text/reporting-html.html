    <h1 class="pagebreak">HTML Report</h1>
    
    <br/>
    
    <p>Archi supports web-based reporting functionality by means of generating HTML pages containing a model tree, summary tables of the model objects and the Views in a model.</p>
    
    <p>This option is available from the "Report->HTML..." menu item from the main "File" menu. Once a model is selected in the Model Tree or in a View this menu item is enabled. Select a folder to export the model and its Views.</p>
    
    <p>A single HTML page, "index.html" is generated in the chosen output folder, together with supporting files and image files for the Views in the model.</p>

    <p class="caption">A generated HTML Report</p>

    <h2>Searching the model</h2>

    <p>Clicking on the magnify icon at the top of the navigation tree reveals a search box which makes it possible to filter the content of the tree.</p>

    <h2>Zooming a view</h2>
    
    <p>It is possible to zoom the view's diagram by using the zoom slider (or the +/- icons) located on the far right of the view's header.</p>
    
    <h2>Masking</h2>
    
    <p>Any folder, concept, or view in the model can be hidden from the HTML report by adding a property in the model object named <code>_hide_from_export_</code> with a value of true. When hiding a folder, all of its content will be hidden as well.</p>
    
    <p><em>Note: hidden objects are still exported and accessible by their direct/permanent URL, but they are removed from the navigation tree and the search feature.</em></p>
    
    <h2>SQL Query</h2>

    <p>The "Query" tab in the report allows you to query the model contents of the report using SQL. For more information see the <a href="https://github.com/archimatetool/archi/wiki/SQL-queries-in-the-HTML-report">Archi Wiki</a>.</p>
