    <p>Note that some key binding commands are not relevant to Archi and are present because of the underlying Eclipse framework. Examples of these are "Add Bookmark", "Close Perspective", "Content Assist" and several others. Should you accidentally invoke a command and Archi does not display or behave as expected, you can reset by selecting "Help -> Reset Archi to Defaults... -> Reset User Interface".</p>
