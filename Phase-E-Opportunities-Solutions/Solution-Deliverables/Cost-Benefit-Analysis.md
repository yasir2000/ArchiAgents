- Implement benefit realization tracking from project start

## Purpose and Scope

### Document Purpose
Provide comprehensive financial analysis of the digital transformation initiative, quantifying costs, benefits, and returns to support investment decisions and establish baseline for ongoing benefit realization tracking.

### Scope
**In Scope:**
- All direct implementation costs across 8 packages
- Operational cost changes and savings
- Revenue impacts and business value creation
- Productivity improvements and efficiency gains
- Risk mitigation value and compliance benefits
- Technology refresh and maintenance cost avoidance

**Out of Scope:**
- Market opportunity costs and competitive positioning
- Intangible benefits not quantifiable in financial terms
- Individual team compensation and HR costs
- Facility and real estate related costs
- Legal and regulatory cost changes beyond compliance

### Objectives
1. Quantify total cost of ownership for the transformation initiative
2. Identify and value all measurable benefits and returns
3. Perform comprehensive financial analysis including NPV, ROI, and IRR
4. Establish benefit realization tracking framework
5. Support investment decision-making with financial evidence

### Success Criteria
- Clear financial justification for transformation investment
- Detailed cost and benefit breakdown by package and timeline
- Risk-adjusted financial projections with sensitivity analysis
- Benefit realization tracking plan with KPIs and milestones
