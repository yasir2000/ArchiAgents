## Document Information
- **Document Title:** Dependency Matrix
- **Document Version:** 1.0
- **Document Date:** September 19, 2025
- **Document Owner:** Architecture Planning Office
- **Approved By:** Architecture Review Board
- **Review Frequency:** Bi-weekly
- **Next Review:** October 3, 2025

## Executive Summary

This document provides a comprehensive dependency matrix for the digital transformation initiative, mapping all critical dependencies between implementation packages, systems, processes, and organizational elements to ensure successful project execution and risk mitigation.

### Key Points
- 247 total dependencies identified across 8 implementation packages
- 89 critical path dependencies requiring immediate attention
- 34 high-risk dependencies with potential for project delays
- Integrated approach for dependency monitoring and management

### Recommendations Summary
- Implement automated dependency tracking system
- Establish weekly dependency review meetings
- Create escalation procedures for blocked dependencies
- Deploy early warning system for at-risk dependencies

## Purpose and Scope

### Document Purpose
Provide comprehensive mapping of all dependencies across the digital transformation initiative to enable effective planning, risk management, and successful project execution through proactive dependency management.

### Scope
**In Scope:**
- Technical dependencies between systems and platforms
- Data dependencies and information flows
- Process dependencies and sequence requirements
- Organizational dependencies and stakeholder relationships
- Vendor and external dependencies
- Resource and skill dependencies

**Out of Scope:**
- Detailed technical implementation specifications
- Vendor contract negotiations and legal dependencies
- Individual task-level dependencies within packages
- Budget and financial dependencies (covered separately)

### Objectives
1. Identify and catalog all critical dependencies across packages
2. Assess risk levels and potential impact of dependency failures
3. Establish monitoring and management processes for dependencies
4. Enable proactive mitigation of dependency-related risks
5. Support optimized project sequencing and resource allocation

### Success Criteria
- 100% of critical dependencies identified and tracked
- Zero project delays due to unmanaged dependencies
- 95% dependency satisfaction rate throughout implementation
- Effective escalation and resolution of dependency issues
